#Searching for new issues
#JIRA treats an empty assignee field as 'unassigned'. You can search for it with 'assignee is empty' â€“  and updatedDate < '2018-03-23' and created < -1d
#For tomorrow we use due > now() AND due <= 2d
#today: updatedDate >= startOfDay() and updatedDate < endOfDay()
#yesterday: updatedDate < -1d AND updatedDate > -2d ORDER BY updatedDate asc
